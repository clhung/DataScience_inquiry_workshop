## Topic 
Forecasting air pollution via a data science approach

## Summary

This is a two-day workshop scheduled in the beginning of the second week of Shodor apprenticeship program. The workshop is designed for students in Grade 8-12 with the goal to gain an authentic experience in data science process by building an air pollution forecasting model. Students will come back in November/December to form teams and lead a data science project from end-to-end. 

During the first day of the workshop, students will use the 2017 U.S. air quality and population data to model the relationship between population and air pollution. By working with this data set, students will learn how to use histograms to describe the distribution of one variable and use scatter plots to describe the relationship between two variables. 

During the second day of the workshop, students will also use two linear models to describe and predict the relationship between air pollutant and population, and use a holdout data set to validate and evaluate the error of the linear models. After all students become familiar with the data, tools, and relevant statistical concepts, students will use the daily air quality, weather, and yearly population data in North Carolina from 2013-2017 to build a PM2.5 forecasting model using the decision tree algorithm. The workshop will conclude with small group presentations to showcase their prediction models.

### Importance

1. The research topic “Human Impacts on Air Pollution” addresses one of the NGSS core ideas in Earth and Space Sciences: _ESS3.C: Human Impacts on Earth Systems_.
2. The statistical concepts used in this workshop align well with NC Mathematics State Core Standards, including _Summarize, represent, and interpret data on two categorical and quantitative variables_ and _Interpret linear models_.
3. This topic is complementary to other ongoing data science curriculum development efforts, such as the [workshops](http://oceansofdata.org/projects/zoom-learning-science-data) developed by ODI.

### Data and Tools

1. Data of U.S. county air quality (five pollutants) and population estimates: air quality data is pulled from EPA Historical Air Quality database. Population estimate data is from U.S. Census Bureau. 
2. Data exploration interface: CODAP with Shodor Interactivate Histogram as a plug-in.
3. Data modeling interface: Jupyter notebook (Google Colab). 
4. Other materials for hands-on activities exploring air pollutants & decision tree model.
5. Using Google products to manage real-time feedback (Form), collaboration (Document & Sheet), data analysis tools (CODAP files) & presentation+demo.
